GAE Unsupervised Anomaly Detection - Analysis Report
==================================================

Issues Identified:
1. FlowBench loader not working - using synthetic graphs
2. All metrics are 0 or NaN - model not learning effectively
3. Synthetic graph creation may not be optimal for GAE
4. Need better data preprocessing and model architecture

Recommendations:
1. Fix FlowBench loader integration
2. Improve synthetic graph creation
3. Tune GAE hyperparameters
4. Add data normalization and preprocessing
5. Consider alternative graph neural network architectures
